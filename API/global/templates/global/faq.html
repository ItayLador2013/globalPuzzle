                <p class="question">What is globalPuzzle LLC’s mission?</p>
                <p class="answer">At globalPuzzle LLC, our mission is to connect individuals who have 
                    relocated to new countries, facilitating the formation of friendships, the discovery 
                    of supportive communities, and the fostering of a sense of belonging. We believe that
                     regardless of location, everyone deserves to feel connected and valued. 
                     Leveraging advanced technology and a comprehensive dataset, 
                     our user-friendly platform matches individuals based on cultural backgrounds, 
                     shared experiences, and personal preferences. By bridging the gap between newcomers
                      and local communities, we enable individuals to build lasting relationships with 
                      like-minded people who understand their challenges and share similar cultural 
                      references. Through our commitment to innovation and inclusivity, 
                      we strive to be the premier platform for anyone seeking friendship, community,

            <div class="QView">
                <p class="question">How does the matching process work?</p>
                <p class="answer">globalPuzzle employs advanced probability-based artificial 
                    intelligence- made entirely by us- to facilitate meaningful connections among 
                    individuals who have recently relocated to a different country, 
                    with similar cultures and backgrounds. Our AI system utilizes a 
                    comprehensive dataset to assess the likelihood of cultural similarity 
                    based on users' country of origin and other factors as such. 
                    We maintain strict standards, allowing only users with a high matching probability 
                    to be included in the list of potential connections. By analyzing user-provided 
                    information, such as stated hobbies, we determine compatibility and generate a 
                    ranked list of the top 12 matches. To promote diverse cultural experiences, our 
                    platform limits the inclusion of users from the same country to a maximum of four 
                    out of the twelve matches. At globalPuzzle, our aim is to foster connections that 
                    enrich cross-cultural interactions and create meaningful relationships.</p>

                    of phishing, we prioritize your safety and recommend taking certain precautions when
